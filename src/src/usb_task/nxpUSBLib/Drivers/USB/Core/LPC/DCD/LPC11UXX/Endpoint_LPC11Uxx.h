			 *  \param[in] Type       Type of endpoint to configure, a \c EP_TYPE_* mask. Not all endpoint types

			 *                        All endpoints (except Control type) are unidirectional - data may only be read

			 *                        to the USB host, or after they have been received from the USB host (depending on
			 *                        the endpoint's data direction). The bank size must indicate the maximum packet size

			 *  \param[in] Banks      Number of banks to use for the endpoint being configured, an \c ENDPOINT_BANK_* mask.
			 *                        More banks uses more USB DPRAM, but offers better performance. Isochronous type
