 *  Architecture macros for selecting the desired target microcontroller architecture. One of these values should be
 *  defined as the value of \c ARCH in the user project makefile via the \c -D compiler switch to GCC, to select the
 *  target architecture.
 *
 *  The selected architecture should remain consistent with the makefile \c ARCH value, which is used to select the
 *  underlying driver source files for each architecture.
